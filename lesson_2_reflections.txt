What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
What happens is that you create a new repository. This way you can begin tracking versions of whatever is going to be in your new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where something is placed to prepare it to be committed. This is also a good way to put together changes that are related to one another and commit them as one set of changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare what you have on your staging area to the latest commit and the working directory so that you can make sure that you have only one logical change. If not you can add or subtract what is on your staging area by using git add and git reset.
