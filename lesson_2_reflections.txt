What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
What happens is that you create a new repository. This way you can begin tracking versions of whatever is going to be in your new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where something is placed to prepare it to be committed. This is also a good way to put together changes that are related to one another and commit them as one set of changes.
