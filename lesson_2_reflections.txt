What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
What happens is that you create a new repository. This way you can begin tracking versions of whatever is going to be in your new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where something is placed to prepare it to be committed. This is also a good way to put together changes that are related to one another and commit them as one set of changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare what you have on your staging area to the latest commit and the working directory so that you can make sure that you have only one logical change. If not you can add or subtract what is on your staging area by using git add and git reset.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I had a new idea that I wanted to try but wanted to have a working version, making a new branch would be fantastic. This way I could test my idea out on one branch and still have a working version on another.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
By looking at the diagrams you can see how each relates to one another and whether or not you'll be able to reach a certain change from the current branch. You may have to change or merge branches to access changes that occurred at a different point along the development of the project.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
This allows us to access the changes that were in one branch that didn't show up in the main one. This is how we can  make the changes in two branches converge. They will order themselves according to time stamp. We represent them in this way so that we can see where the changes came from.
