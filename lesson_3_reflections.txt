Behold! reflections for lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you want to work with someone over the internet or if you will need to access changes from a different location using a  remote repository can help you work from anywhere you might find yourself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If it automatically pulls, it may cause problems if you are working on a project, especially if there were changes made to  the same file you're currently working on.
